 ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

It's Hakim! I'm a passionate and fully dedicated business analyst with over 5 years of experience helping both national and multinational companies unlock the power of data. I thrive on critical thinking and a strong data-driven mindset, using insights to tell the real story behind numbers and guide business strategy.

From assessing how close a company is to hitting its targets to crafting clear, actionable plansâ€”Iâ€™ve done it all across different industries. My toolkit? A solid blend of business acumen, data processing tools like Excel and Python, and powerful visualization with Power BI and Tableau. Spotting what matters most and building smart strategies is where I shine!
